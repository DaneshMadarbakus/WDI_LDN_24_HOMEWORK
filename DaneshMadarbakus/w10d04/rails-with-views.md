# Ruby on Rails 

### Introduction 

Your task is to build a Ruby on Rails app. You can build anything, but it must meet the requirements below.

This is the last time we will be using Rails with views before we move to Rails API, so use this time to explore what Rails can do out of the box.

### Requirements

* At least one `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship
* At least one `has_many` and `belongs_to` relationship

###Â Tips

* Plan your database structure using ERD diagrams
* You might want to base your site on an exising app, e.g Kickstarter
* Avoid having a 'user' model - we'll be looking at users and authentication next week
* Keep the views standard, i.e don't put a comment form on a show page

### Bonus

* Add the [Boostrap 4 gem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem) to your app
* Style your app
* Look at adding [partials](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials) to your app, e.g add a partial for the navbar
